## Requirements

Write a simple Blogging application using React Native:

- [x] After opening the app, users should see all published blog posts, sorted by date (newest on top).
- [x] No authentication should be required to read blog posts from all users.
- [x] A user should be able to “pull to refresh” on blog post lists to refresh the blog list.
- [x] A user should be able to share any blog post (it should be implemented with native share OS feature). Any other user should be able to open the shared deep link inside the app.
- [x] Users must be able to create an account and log in.
- [x] To be able to write a blog post, users must be logged in.
- [x] A user should be able to edit or delete their blog posts.
- [x] Every blog post must contain an author, title, cover image, blog text, and date of publishing.
- [x] Cover image must be added using the device camera or accessing the camera roll (up to user choice). 
- [x] Minimal UI/UX design is needed. You will not be marked by graphic design. However, do try to keep it as tidy as possible
- [x] You may write your own custom backend or use any available 3rd party backend services (Firebase or similar).
- [ ] The project should be demonstrated either on the iOS or Android platforms. This means that if you chose iOS, you wouldn’t need to show the project on any Android devices, but it will need to run well on all iOS phones, not just on one selected.
- [ ] Write unit and e2e tests for bonus points.
